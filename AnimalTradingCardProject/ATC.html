        <p>
          Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they were bred by
          the chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling and companionship. They
          are an active, energetic, resilient breed. These days Huskies are kept
          as house pets but they are still used as sled dogs by competitive and
          recreational mushers.
